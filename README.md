# Simple_Viewer
 
Simply run main.py and the GUI is shown. Then you can select a folder(root) with structure:
~~~python
root---comic1---chapter 1
     |        |- ...
     |         -chapter n
     |
      -comic2---chapter 1
              |- ...
               -chapter n
~~~
to indicate a folder containing comics. Then the selectable items are used to access a certain one.
